## Background & Description
🔥 Welcome to **HUSTLE ATL**! 🔥<br /> 
Where we build community one run at a time. 

The inspiration behind this app came from speaking with my friend, Andrew, who plays basketball competitively and frequently hosts pick-up runs in Atlanta. He shared with me his idea of creating an app that assists people with scheduling gym rentals and managing payments. With his permission and willingness to work with me, I decided to use this as an opportunity to take on my first client.

A few of the current problems Andrew and his friends were dealing with when scheduling runs include:
  - inconvenience of messaging people back and forth on whether they plan to attend
  - managing payments by sending out Venmo requests

Though this app does not solve all the issues at hand, I thoroughly enjoyed creating a project with the intention of helping others and hopefully making their lives just a little bit easier.
